                    This utility will modify your Torrent files so that communications between
                    your BitTorrent client and the actual BitTorrent tracker will be proxied
                    by this host. The purpose of this tracker proxy is to slightly alter the
                    transactions between your BitTorrent client and the actual tracker in 
                    the following ways:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    You may designate the proxy to use different peer_id and
                    User-Agent strings so as to work around private trackers 
                    that may be blocking your particular client or version.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    You may also specify an upload manipulation formula so as
                    to alter the upload / download statistic sent to the tracker.
                    <br /><br />
                    The upload manipulation modes are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>No Manipulation</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Nothing is done to your upload amount.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Upload = N * Download</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adjust your upload amount to some proportion of 
                                    your download amount. <br />
                                    NOTE: In this mode your upload amount will only 
                                    be changed if your download &gt; upload.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Upload = N * Upload</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Multiply your actual upload amount by some factor.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    This is useful for torrents that are tracked by private trackers, that 
                    enforce a strict upload / download ratio amongst their members.

                    <b>To Use:</b> <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li>Locate and enter the torrent file you wish to proxy</li>
                        <li>Select the client emulator to use (if any)</li>
                        <li>Select the upload statistic manipulator you
                             wish you use (if any)</li>
                        <li>Enter the upload manipulation coefficient
                             (don't be an ass and set it too high)</li>
                        <li>If you choose, you may enter the ip address of
                            your client (the proxy will try to figure this
                            out itself; see below).</li>
                        <li>Hit "Create" to create the proxied torrent file</li>
                    </ol>
                    You may load the resulting proxied torrent file into your
                    BitTorrent client to begin downloading.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    IP addresses: <br />
                    <br />
                    The IP address sent to the tracker is the one from which
                    your proxy request originated. However, if your client 
                    specifies its own IP address in its tracker request,
                    that one is used instead. (Azureus and other clients allow you
                    to do this from the config menu).  If your client does not
                    support this, and you are behind another L7 proxy, you may
                    specify your IP address in the appropriate field to the
                    left.  Under normal circumstances, however, you should not
                    need to configure this option.
